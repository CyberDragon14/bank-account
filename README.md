# bank-account
# Program Description

# This Java program is designed to manage a user's bank account balance each month. 
# The program has the user enter their initial account balance followed by a series of transactions. 
# The valid transaction types are:
#   C - process a withdraw.
#   D - process a deposit.
#   E - perform end of program processing and exit the program.

# For withdraws and deposits, the user is prompted to enter the transaction amount.
# The user is charged a service fee for a transaction that results in a negative balance.
# A $0.25 service fee is applied for every transaction processed, except end or program processesing.
# This program loops until the user chooses the "Quit - End program processesing" option
# Once the user quits the program, output is displayed showing the user their final balance and total charges/fees deducted.
